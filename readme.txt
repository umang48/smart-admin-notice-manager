*   **Auto-hide Repeated**: Identical notices are automatically de-duplicated.
*   **Snooze**: "Remind me later" button to hide notices for 24 hours.
*   **Dismiss**: Permanently hide notices.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/smart-admin-notice-manager` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
